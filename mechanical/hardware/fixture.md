## Vibration fixtures

#### Considerations
1. Frequency range and amplitude of test. 
2. Number of samples. 
3. Device orientation. 

#### Design 
1. Match device orientation.
2. Maximize stiffness and decrease weight. 
    - High stiffness = accurate vibration inputs. 
    - Low weight = less damage on vibration hardware. 
3. Boundary conditions should be maintained
    - Same mounting points. 
    - Same mounting fasteners. 
    - Same mounting geometry. 
    - Same mounting materials. 
    - Same vehicle orientation.
4. Minimal fixture vibration modes. 
    - Amplification will happen at these resonance modes. 
    - These modes should be outside excitation frequencies of test. 
    - Natural frequencies can be found with CAE, manual modal analysis, or sine sweeps of hardware. 
5. Fixture hole patterns to cover all table types.
