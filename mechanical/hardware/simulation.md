Simulation

Under simulation file view

. I1 = idealized file Idealization simplifies geometry: anything in this file does not go back to 000 file. Great for removing features if you donâ€™t want them in simulation.
Fem: put all mesh, material properties, thickness
Sim: put on constrains and run sim

Check "Create idealized part"
Double click revision on sim to match
Setup solution

Pick desired name

Analysis type: Structural
2D solid option: None
Solution Type: SOL 103 Real Eigenvalues
Ok
In Idealized file (i1, i2, i3, etc)

Simulation Navigator > Simulation File View
Double click on idealized file.
Promote bodies. Select the ones you want > Ok
Resource bar > Part Navigator (to see all promoted bodies.
Hide all parts and show promoted bodies.
Thin plate method

For bodies you want to extend both directions:

Geometry Preparation > Create mid surface pairs
Select bodies
Auto create face pairs (icon with 2 yellow/orange) curved layers.
For bodies you want to extend only one

Geometry Preparation > More > offset surface
Select "Single Face" from selection drop down.
Extend edge so it touches
Geometry Preparation > More > Extend Sheet
Select Edges
Select Face
Trim portions
Insert plane: More > Datum plane
Select faces
Select boundary (the plane you created)
In FEM file (fem1, fem2, etc)

Hide all bodies before getting started. (Ctrl + w)
Create 2D mesh

Initial 2D mesh
Home > 2D Mesh
Set 2D Mesh options
Type: CQUAD4
Make sure destination collector is the same > unselect automatic creation
Ok
Make mesh more visible
2D collectors> thin shell > right click 2d mesh > edit display > shaded edge color > set color to white.
Do mesh mating:
Stitch edge > manual > edge to face > select edge and face > apply
Update (in upper left)
If mesh error:
Play around with tolerances
Create new mesh collector to apply thicknesses

One collector for each thickness
Create Mesh collector if Meshes are not already organized
Mesh collector > 2D, thin shell, Pshell, and name something useful
Drop mesh into collector
Drag and drop mesh into Base / support
Definite collector thicknesses
Next to pshell click edit wrench.
Input default thickness
View thicknesses
Right click on collector > edit display > select > element thickness and offset
Create mass representation

Nodes and elements > Element Create
Element family: 0D
Type: CONM2
Click on option window and enter mass, Ok
Nodes and Points, click point dialog and input coordinates
Node labels: anything useful
Change display
Change color
Add "Marker type" to actually see it.
Add Mass and inertia values
0D Mesh > Edit Mesh Associated Data > Select Mesh
RBE3

RBE2 vs 3:

Reality is somewhere in between. Try both and compare.
RBE3- distribute out weight, RBE2 - adds stiffness 
Home > 1D connection
Node to Node
Source and target
Source : mass
Target: select all anchors! (not just one)
Type: RBE3
Mesh Check

Add constraints

Constraint type > User defined constraint
Select face
Select all fixed
Make sure fix is correct:
For bolts: pick nodes and fix mesh at bolt holes.

Finishes and Checks

Solid properties check
Checks and information > More > Solid properties check
Highlight everything: check total mass and confirm it matches expected
"Duplicate elements": any element that are coincidence and not connected.
"Duplicate notes": any notes on top of each other but not connected. 
Can select "Displayed" to do whole object!
Solid properties check": Make sure solid properties (mass, CM, etc) match expected.
Look at strain energy and kinetic energy to know where mass can be removed and where it should be added.
