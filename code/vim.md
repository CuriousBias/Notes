# Vim
- why? 

### Edit file
- press "a"
- press "esc" + ":" to exit
- hold "shift" + "v" to select whole lines

### Deleting multiple lines

1. If able to type -> press "esc" (esc put you in document edit mode vs typing mode)
2. Type the number of lines you want to delete Ex "10" you wont see the number 10 appear
3. Type "dd" and the 10 lines will be deleted
4. Or just type "dd" to delete a whole line
5. Or just "dw" to delete one word
6. Or just "d" to delete one character.
